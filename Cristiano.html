      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.">Manchester United</a>
      <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni,
        who was impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
         under-17 and under-18 teams,
        the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002,
         Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October,
         he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season,
         his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger,
         who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[25]</p>
